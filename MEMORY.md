### CV Download Function Fix (2025-01-15) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: CV download function was throwing error "The filename and the fallback cannot contain the '/' and '\' characters" due to unsafe filename generation.

**Solution**:

-   Updated `downloadCV()` method in `RecruitmentCandidateController`:
    -   Applied strict `preg_replace('/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/', '', $string)` to remove ALL special characters
    -   Sanitized both candidate name and candidate number separately
    -   Used `pathinfo()` to get correct file extension from original file
    -   Created safe filename format: `CV_{sanitized_name}_{sanitized_number}.{extension}`

### DataTables Action Button Simplification (2025-01-15) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: DataTables action buttons were too cluttered with multiple functions (CV download/delete, blacklist) making the interface complex and potentially confusing.

**Solution**:

-   **Simplified Action Buttons**: Reduced to essential actions only:
    -   **Show**: View candidate details (eye icon, blue)
    -   **Edit**: Edit candidate information (edit icon, yellow)
    -   **Apply**: Apply to FPTK (plus icon, blue) - only for available candidates
    -   **Delete**: Delete candidate (trash icon, red)
-   **Removed Complex Functions**: Eliminated from DataTables:
    -   CV download/delete split button (available in detail pages)
    -   Blacklist/remove blacklist buttons (available in detail pages)
-   **Maintained Functionality**: All functions still available in appropriate detail pages

**Key Benefits**:

-   **Cleaner Interface**: Less cluttered DataTables action column
-   **Better UX**: Focus on essential actions in list view

-   Action button hierarchy should prioritize most common tasks

### DataTables Filter Functionality Fix (2025-01-15) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Several DataTables filters were not functioning properly due to mismatched field names between view and controller, and missing filter implementations.

**Solution**:

-   **Added Missing Filters**:
    -   `candidate_number` filter in view and controller
    -   `phone` filter in controller (was missing)
-   **Fixed Field Name Mismatches**:
    -   Changed `date_from`/`date_to` to `registration_date_from`/`registration_date_to` in controller
    -   Removed `experience_years` references from JavaScript (field was removed)
-   **Improved Filter Logic**:
    -   `education_level` now uses exact match instead of LIKE
    -   Date filters use proper `whereDate()` for date comparison
    -   Added proper JavaScript event handlers for all filter fields
-   **Enhanced Reset Functionality**:
    -   Reset button now clears all filter fields
    -   Proper trigger of change events for select fields

**Key Benefits**:

-   **Complete Filter Coverage**: All filter fields now work correctly
-   **Better Search Accuracy**: Exact matches for dropdown fields, LIKE for text fields
-   **Consistent Field Names**: View and controller use same field names
-   **Improved UX**: All filters respond immediately to user input

**Key Learning**:

-   Always ensure field names match between view and controller
-   Use appropriate filter methods (exact vs LIKE) based on field type
-   JavaScript event handlers must match actual field IDs
-   Reset functionality should clear all filter fields consistently
