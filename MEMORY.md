-   2025-08-08 - Recruitment sessions table alignment

-   Added migration `2025_08_08_100100_update_recruitment_sessions_table.php` to align schema with new stage structure (cv_review → onboarding):
    -   Ensured `current_stage` and `stage_status` enums include the correct values.
    -   Added missing columns when absent: `stage_started_at`, `stage_completed_at`, `overall_progress`, `next_action`, `responsible_person_id` (FK), `final_decision_date`, `final_decision_by` (FK), `final_decision_notes`, `stage_durations` (JSON), `created_by` (FK).
    -   Dropped legacy `final_status` column if present.
    -   Added indexes for common query fields.
    -   Non-destructive where possible; guarded enum alters with try/catch for compatibility.

**Solution**:

-   Added `getEstimatedNextNumber()` and `getEstimatedNextNumbersForAllCategories()` methods to LetterNumber model to calculate next numbers based on numbering behavior (annual_reset vs continuous)
-   Enhanced LetterNumberController create method to pass estimated next numbers and last few numbers for each category
-   Created comprehensive "Estimated Next Numbers" section in create.blade.php showing:
    -   Next letter number preview for each category with sequence and year info
    -   Numbering behavior badges (Annual Reset/Continuous) with icons
    -   Recent letter numbers for context (last 3 numbers per category)
    -   Summary statistics (total categories, categories with numbers, total sequences)
-   Added dynamic next number preview in form area when category is selected
-   Implemented responsive grid layout with AdminLTE info-box styling and custom CSS
-   Added error handling and null checks for robust data display

**Key Learning**:

-   Numbering behavior (annual_reset vs continuous) significantly affects sequence calculation logic
-   Visual representation of next numbers helps users understand the system before creating letters

**Solution**:

-   Added four new methods to DebugController: `truncateLetterNumbers()`, `truncateLetterCategories()`, `truncateLetterSubjects()`, and `truncateLetterAll()`
-   Implemented proper foreign key constraint handling with `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0/1` for safe truncation
-   Added corresponding routes in web.php: `/truncate/letter-numbers`, `/truncate/letter-categories`, `/truncate/letter-subjects`, `/truncate/letter-all`
-   Created new "Letter Management" tab in debug/index.blade.php with individual truncate buttons and bulk operation
-   Used consistent AdminLTE styling with info color scheme and proper confirmation dialogs
-   Maintained same pattern as existing recruitment and employee truncate functionality

**Key Learning**:

-   Foreign key constraints must be temporarily disabled during truncate operations to avoid constraint violations
-   Truncate order matters: child tables should be truncated before parent tables
-   UI consistency is important - following existing patterns makes the interface intuitive
-   Bulk operations should be clearly separated from individual table operations with appropriate warning styling

### SKPK Category NIK Requirement Removal (2025-01-15) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: The SKPK letter category was requiring NIK validation during import, causing validation errors as shown in the import validation screenshot where NIK "15740" was flagged as required but doesn't exist in administrations.

**Key Learning**:

-   Model naming consistency is crucial for maintainable code; avoid legacy model references
-   JavaScript form handling must match backend expected inputs exactly
-   Compatibility methods can bridge gaps between service expectations and actual model structure
-   Missing models should be created based on existing migrations rather than removing references

2025-08-08 - Refactor RecruitmentSessionController

2025-08-08 - Refactor recruitment session blades to align with controller/routes

-   2025-08-08 - Cleanup unused JS handlers in `show-session`

-   Removed dead click bindings and custom AJAX handler functions in `resources/views/recruitment/sessions/show-session.blade.php` (`handle*Submission`, `handleAdvanceStage`, etc.) since forms now submit normally with hidden `assessment_data`.
-   Kept calculation helpers for interview overall scores; removed duplicate/unused helpers.
-   Lint clean.

-   Updated `resources/views/recruitment/sessions/partials/modals.blade.php` to use direct endpoints for actions: `advance-stage`, `reject`, `complete`, `cancel`, avoiding undefined `route()` helpers.
-   Updated `resources/views/recruitment/sessions/show-session.blade.php` JS AJAX URLs to direct endpoints matching `/recruitment/sessions/{id}/...`.
-   Verified no lints after changes.

-   Removed unused private helpers: `validatePreviousStages`, `getExpectedCurrentStage`, and `getPreviousStageValidationMessage` which had no references in routes or views after workflow rework.
-   Dropped unused constructor dependency `RecruitmentWorkflowService` from `RecruitmentSessionController` to simplify dependencies.
-   Verified routes reference only: `index`, `getSessions`, `dashboard`, `show`, `showSession`, `store`, `destroy`, `getSessionData`, `getSessionsByFPTK`, `getSessionsByCandidate`.
-   Ran linter on `app/Http/Controllers/RecruitmentSessionController.php` with no issues.

## Recent Changes and Learnings

### SKPK Category NIK Requirement Removal (2025-01-15) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: User requested to remove NIK requirement for SKPK category in letter number import to allow import process to continue even when NIK is not yet available in administrations table.

**Solution**:

-   Modified `app/Imports/LetterAdministrationImport.php`: Removed 'SKPK' from categories requiring NIK validation
-   Updated `app/Http/Controllers/LetterNumberController.php`: Removed `administration_id` requirement for SKPK in both store and update methods
-   Updated frontend views: Removed employee selection field for SKPK category in create and edit forms
-   Updated documentation in `docs/LETTER_NUMBERING_SYSTEM.md`

**Key Learning**: When removing validation requirements, ensure consistency across import validation, controller validation, and frontend UI components.

### Multiple Categories NIK Requirement Removal (2025-01-15) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: User requested to allow import for other categories that require NIK (PKWT, PAR, CRTE) to proceed even when NIK is not yet available in administrations table.

**Solution**:

-   Modified `app/Imports/LetterAdministrationImport.php`: Changed NIK validation from `'nullable|exists:administrations,nik'` to `'nullable'` to remove existence check
-   Updated `app/Http/Controllers/LetterNumberController.php`: Removed `administration_id` requirement for PKWT, PAR, and CRTE categories in both store and update methods
-   Frontend views: Employee selection fields remain visible for PKWT, PAR, and CRTE categories but are now nullable (not required) for manual create/edit processes
-   Updated documentation in `docs/LETTER_NUMBERING_SYSTEM.md` to reflect all changes

**Key Learning**: For import processes, it's often better to allow data import without strict foreign key validation, especially when dealing with data that may not be fully synchronized across tables yet. This approach enables bulk data processing while maintaining data integrity through application-level validation. For manual processes, keeping fields visible but nullable provides better user experience.

**Categories Affected**:

-   **SKPK**: Surat Keterangan Pengalaman Kerja - No longer requires NIK
-   **PKWT**: Perjanjian Kerja Waktu Tertentu - No longer requires NIK
-   **PAR**: Personal Action Request - No longer requires NIK
-   **CRTE**: Certificate - No longer requires NIK

**Technical Changes**:

1. Import validation: NIK field is now `nullable` without existence check
2. Controller validation: `administration_id` field no longer required for affected categories
3. Frontend UI: Employee selection fields remain visible but are nullable (not required) for manual processes
4. Documentation: Updated to reflect current validation rules

**Important Note**: Employee selection fields are still displayed in the UI for manual create/edit processes to maintain good user experience, but they are no longer required. This allows users to optionally select an employee if available, while still being able to proceed without selection.

### PKWT Type Enum Update (2025-01-15) ✅ COMPLETE

-   **Data Migration**: Existing data mapped from old enum to new enum (PKWT I/II/III → PKWT)
-   **Code Updates**: Updated all references in controller, import, views, and documentation
-   **Backward Compatibility**: Migration includes rollback functionality to restore old enum values

**Migration Approach**:

-   **Up**: Add new column → Copy data with mapping → Drop old column → Rename new column
-   **Down**: Add old column → Copy data with reverse mapping → Drop new column → Rename old column
-   **Data Safety**: No data loss, all existing values properly mapped
