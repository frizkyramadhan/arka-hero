# Legacy Approval System Removal

## Overview

This document describes the removal of the legacy approval system from the Official Travels (LOT) module. The legacy system used direct recommendation and approval fields in the `officialtravels` table, which has been replaced with the new dynamic approval system using `approval_plans` and `approval_stages` tables.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Changes

#### Migration: `2025_09_15_133236_remove_legacy_approval_fields_from_officialtravels_table.php`

**Removed Fields:**

-   `recommendation_status` (ENUM: pending, approved, rejected)
-   `recommendation_remark` (TEXT)
-   `recommendation_by` (Foreign Key to users)
-   `recommendation_date` (DATETIME)
-   `recommendation_timestamps` (TIMESTAMP)
-   `approval_status` (ENUM: pending, approved, rejected)
-   `approval_remark` (TEXT)
-   `approval_by` (Foreign Key to users)
-   `approval_date` (DATETIME)
-   `approval_timestamps` (TIMESTAMP)

**Foreign Key Constraints Removed:**

-   `officialtravels_recommendation_by_foreign`
-   `officialtravels_approval_by_foreign`

### 2. Model Changes

#### `app/Models/Officialtravel.php`

**Removed:**

-   Legacy approval field casts
-   `RECOMMENDATION_STATUSES` and `APPROVAL_STATUSES` constants
-   `recommender()` relationship method
-   `approver()` relationship method

**Kept:**

-   New approval system via `approval_plans()` relationship
-   All other relationships and functionality

### 3. Controller Changes

#### `app/Http/Controllers/OfficialtravelController.php`

**Removed:**

-   Legacy permission middleware for recommend/approve
-   Legacy approval field validation rules
-   Legacy approval field assignments in store method
-   Legacy approval relationships in queries
-   All commented legacy methods:
    -   `showRecommendForm()`
    -   `recommend()`
    -   `showApprovalForm()`
    -   `approve()`

**Kept:**

-   New approval system integration
-   All other functionality remains intact

### 4. Route Changes

#### `routes/web.php`

**Removed:**

-   `officialtravels.showRecommendForm` route
-   `officialtravels.recommend` route
-   `officialtravels.showApprovalForm` route
-   `officialtravels.approve` route

**Kept:**

-   All other officialtravels routes
-   New approval system routes

### 5. View Changes

#### Deleted Files:

-   `resources/views/officialtravels/recommend.blade.php`
-   `resources/views/officialtravels/approve.blade.php`

#### Modified Files:

-   `resources/views/officialtravels/show.blade.php`
    -   Removed legacy recommendation/approval button sections
    -   Removed legacy CSS styles for recommend/approve buttons
    -   Kept new approval system integration

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts:

1. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed ~200 lines of commented legacy code
2. **Simplified Database**: Removed 10 unused fields and 2 foreign key constraints
3. **Consistent Architecture**: All documents now use the same approval system
4. **Reduced Maintenance**: No need to maintain dual approval systems
5. **Better Performance**: Smaller table size and fewer relationships to load

### No Breaking Changes:

-   All existing functionality preserved
-   New approval system handles all approval workflows
-   API endpoints remain unchanged
-   User interface remains functional

## Migration Notes

### For Developers:

1. **Database Migration**: Run `php artisan migrate` to apply changes
2. **Code References**: All legacy approval field references have been removed
3. **Testing**: Ensure all approval workflows still function correctly

### For Users:

-   No impact on user experience
-   All approval functionality continues to work through the new system
-   No data loss (legacy fields were not actively used)

## Verification Steps

1. **Database Verification:**

    ```sql
    DESCRIBE officialtravels;
    -- Verify legacy fields are removed
    ```

2. **Functionality Verification:**

    - Create new LOT → should work with new approval system
    - Submit for approval → should create approval plans
    - Process approvals → should work through approval requests
    - Print LOT → should work without legacy fields

3. **Code Verification:**
    - No references to legacy fields in codebase
    - All tests pass
    - No linting errors

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed, the migration can be reversed:

```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1
```

This will restore the legacy fields, but the removed code would need to be manually restored from version control.

## Conclusion

The legacy approval system has been successfully removed from the Official Travels module. The system now uses a unified, dynamic approval system that is more flexible and maintainable. All functionality has been preserved while improving code quality and reducing technical debt.
